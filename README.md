Slides for my talk at [Bath Digital Festival 2019](https://bathdigitalfestival.co.uk/speakers/-/sam-ollason.html).

At the talk I shared my experiences of developing mobile applications with React Native and Swift.
I compared the development experience across different areas and concluded that I overall prefer developing
with React Native.

I created the slides with a React-based tool called Spectacle. You can view the live presentation [here](https://samollason.github.io/bdf-oct-2019-presentation/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
